# Android Setup Instructions

## Get the game on your phone
To get the game running on your Android phone right away, download and install the [APK file](https://66762pinballlizard.blob.core.windows.net/pinballlizard/PinballLizard.apk).

## Configure the backend

To play the game, you'll need to set up the backend through Azure PlayFab. We've created a [setup wizard](Deployment) to help. Follow the instructions in the setup wizard to configure with PlayFab.

## Connect the backend to the game

Once your backend is configured, you can connect it to the phone app by entering the TitleID, which you used in the setup wizard. Once the game is connected to your backend, you can start playing and see the activity in your Game Manager.
