# iOS Setup Instructions

## Get the game on your phone

To get the game on your iOS phone, you’ll first need to clone the project. From there, you’ll need to build the game to your mobile device through Unity. Instructions for this can be found in Unity’s documentation for building on [iOS](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/mobile-touch/building-your-unity-game-ios-device-testing?playlist=17138).

## Configure the backend

To play the game, you'll need to set up the backend through Azure PlayFab. We've created a [setup wizard](Deployment) to help. Follow the instructions in the setup wizard to configure with PlayFab.

## Connect the backend to the game

Once your backend is configured, you can connect it to the phone app by entering the TitleID, which you used in the setup wizard. Once the game is connected to your backend, you can start playing and see the activity in your Game Manager.
